# Introduction

The [Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) is widely used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning purposes.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

We are going to build a machine learning model to distinguish the species from each other based on the combination of these four features.
