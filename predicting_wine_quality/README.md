This project describes how wine quality can be predicted using Machine Learning regression techniques. 

[Wine Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) is used to build various regression models to predict the quality of a wine.
